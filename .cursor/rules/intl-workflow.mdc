# Intl Workflow Rule

When adding or changing user-facing copy in `vivian-client`, use the i18n workflow by default.

- Treat `messages/en.json` as the source of truth for English UI text.
- Add new copy as translation keys in `messages/en.json` instead of inline JSX/TS string literals.
- Access text through a translation helper (`t("...")`, `useTranslations()`, or project equivalent), not hardcoded strings.
- Prefer stable, namespaced keys (example: `settings.google.connectButton`), not raw sentence keys.
- Reuse existing keys when wording is the same across screens.
- Keep placeholders/interpolation in translations (example: `"lastConnected": "Last connected: {date}"`), not string concatenation in components.
- For validation/errors and toast messages shown to users, use translation keys as well.

## Migration Expectation

If you touch a file that still has hardcoded user-facing strings, migrate those touched strings to `messages/en.json` in the same change when practical.

## Scope

This rule applies to:

- `app/**`
- `components/**`
- client-side helpers that return user-visible copy

This rule does not apply to:

- internal logs/telemetry not shown to users
- test-only fixture strings
- API field names and protocol constants
