# No Hardcoded UI Strings

Do not introduce new hardcoded user-facing strings in TypeScript/TSX files.

- Before adding UI copy, check `messages/en.json` for an existing key.
- If no key exists, add one to `messages/en.json` and reference it via the translation layer.
- Replace hardcoded literals in files you modify, unless doing so would create unrelated risk.
- Use interpolation/plurals in translation resources instead of branching on raw strings in components.

## PR Checklist

- [ ] No new user-facing hardcoded strings were added.
- [ ] Added/updated keys in `messages/en.json` for any new copy.
- [ ] Components/pages reference translation keys, not inline copy.
